>With the many film review sites on the internet, I found it frustrating that the reviews frequently had an agenda. Indeed,I have found that I could not trust them. There are reasons for this. Primarily it’s that most reviews come from one source or publisher, and the others from the general public, who mainly are not professional film reviewers, rather individuals voicing an opinion. However, in both situations a bias agenda exits, nonetheless. I wanted to balance this out somewhat. Therefore, I decided to take the best from both sides of reviewer types and see what I could come up with.I decided to make a film review website, that can be controlled to eliminate the bias as much as possible. Therefore, I set the following brief to attain a site suited to something I would like to see.

>## Project Brief ##

I was asked to create a MOVIE REVIEW WEBSITE that will help promote reviews for movies past and present in a professionally critiqued manner.The site will differ from others by the fact of sourcing reviews from people who are serious film reviewers. We do not wish to have clickbait or slander in respect to our reviews of films, but calm considered critique. We also wish to distance ourselves from the two predominant types of reviewers.

The first, a homogenous company having the hidden agenda of reviews favouring particular movie production companies via a nepotist back channel. The other reviewer class  we wish to distance ourselves from, is the many millennial ‘woke’ childish reviews that target films that do not conform to their partisan view of what a film should be, for slander.

We want a clean looking site, with calm considered reviews, that present reviews within the 'class' a film was intended for. For example,  comparing a low budget film with a tent pole monster $200 million dollar production is simply ridiculous. To help solve this issue, each reviewer be sourced from the public, however, they will not be allowed to post reviews without membership and agreeing to our terms and conditions.Secondly the reviewers will have segregated topic areas with regards to the film review, and a corresponding section for a citation supporting their review on that section. I feel this will be a good approach because it will cause the poster to validate any assertions made.

* **Each review should be carried out in-line with a comparison to a film of similar genre and production budget.** Otherwise the reviews are unfair.
* Each review will be supported with one image of the film (usually the production released public poster).
* Particular review attributes must be present. These include Title, sub-title, genre, stars (0-5).
* Each reviewer will have the autonomy to administrate their reviews by update or delete. However, they cannot interfere with other reviewers reviews of course.
* The public will be able to search for a particular title, or browse through existing reviews
